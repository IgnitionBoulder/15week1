### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### meta
**Why do we separate HTML and CSS?**<br>
Keeping the languages seperate allows for the code to be more manageable, as well as more efficient and simpler to understand/apply changes when necessary.
<br>

#### HTML
**What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?**<br>
Both Classes and IDs are used when styling HTML markup. They are different in that classes define the characteristics of an object in HTML. Classes can be linked to various objects, allowing for them <strong>all</strong> to have consistent formatting. IDs are used for specific, individual elements, rather than various ones. <br>

**What are elements?**<br>
An HTML element is any content that is bound by a start tag and an end tag.<br>
**What are tags?**<br>
Tags are commands, basically, that bind an element. Tags are held between "less than" and "greater than" symbols, and mark the beginning and the end of an element. <br>
**What are attributes?**<br>
Attributes provide additional information about an element and are contained in the start tag. <br>
**What are forms?**<br>
HTML forms are used to collect user input, and define an HTML form. <br>
**What is a div?**<br>  
divs are used in HTML and CSS documents. In HTML, they define a division or section in the document. In CSS, divs group block-elements in order to format them properly. <br>

**What are selectors?**<br>
Selectors are used in CSS and allow the developer to select and manipulate HTML elements. They can "find" HTML elements based on their ID's, Classes, or attributes. <br>
What are properties?  
What are values?  
How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?  
What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?
