Why do we separate HTML and CSS?  
We seperate HTML and CSS to make maintaining code easier, keeps code more efficent and it's standard programming practice
#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?
They both indicate differt parts of your webpage that can be modified using CSS or Javascript. When one manipulates a class using CSS or Javascript they are modifying all the Ids within that class. When one edits a ID using CSS or Javascript they only manipulate one specific element of a webpage. 
What are elements?  
HTML elements are individual components of a webpage. They tend to mark the begining and end of a webpage 

What are tags?  
HTML tags apply meaning to elements of a webpage and help apply context to the actual code within the webpage.

How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?  
What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?

### Section 3: Git and Github  
What is Git?  
Git is a version Control system that helps keep track of changes in one's code.
What is SCM?  
What is a VCS? 
A version control system is a tool that a developer or group of developers use to keep track of changes with in a project.
Why is Git useful for a developer?  
Why is Git useful for a team of developers?  
Git allows a team of developers to track changes with in their document. It also useful if one wanted to have seperate team members modify certain features in an application. For example they can build seperate branches so they can experiment with the code without messing with the running product. 

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?  
How do you create it on Github?  
How do you commit changes?  
What is the difference between staging and committing changes?  
What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?  
What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?  
What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  What are a few interesting variations (sets of options)? 

"git log" Shows commit logs.
"git log -follow" Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file).
"git log -log-size" Include a line “log size <number>” in the output for each commit, where <number> is the length of that commit’s message in bytes. 
How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?  
"http://github.com/<username>/<project>/commits/<branch>/"
<username> is the username of the person that owns the repo
<project> is the repo name
<branch> can be 'master' or any other branch
What is a "Merge"?  
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
What is a "Pull Request"?
These an area for discussion for when a developer makes a change on a repo and wants others to review it. 
What is "Forking" a repo? 
It's producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. 
What is "Cloning" a repo?  
This will copy the entire history of that project so you have it locally and it will give you a working directory of the main branch of that project so you can look at the code or start editing it
