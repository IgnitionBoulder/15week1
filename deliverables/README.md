# Week 1 Deliverable  

### Instructions  

In order to deliver homework consisting of questions and answers, just edit this file and commit the changes.  Once your answers are on Github, specifically in this file, you have delivered your homework.  
  
To answer questions, please just put the answer on the next line after the question.  Put a blank line after the answer to separate it visually from the next question.

**What is your quest?**
I seek knowledge in everything that I find interesting and exciting.  

**What is your favorite color?**
Don't really have one, but if I were to pick, I would say red.

### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### Meta
Why do we separate HTML and CSS?  
Modularization, or in this case the separation of HTML and CSS, allow for efficiency, 
maintainability and reusability. This separation allows for low coupling, making updating or debugging 
our file much easier since only one part has to be dealt with, and it is easier to identify and modify.
On the same note, we can reuse our code much easier when they are separated, since they have low coupling.


#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?  
Classes are HTML attributes that allow assigning of one or more subtypes to an element of a certain type.
IDs are attributes used to provide unique identifiers to elements within a document. The difference is that 
the ID attribute has to be absolutely unique for an element within a page, whereas the class attribute may
be used to apply the same value to multiple elements in a page.

What are elements?  
Elements consist of start and closing tags, and whatever lies in between them (ie. can be text etc).

What are tags?  


What are attributes?  
What are forms?  
What is a div?

#### CSS
What are selectors?  
What are properties?  
What are values?  
How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?  
What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?  

#### Android
Put your html code in the `android.html` file in this folder.

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?  
How do you create it on Github?  
How do you commit changes?  
What is the difference between staging and committing changes?  
What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?  
What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?  
What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  What are a few interesting variations (sets of options)?  
How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?  
What is a "Merge"?  
What is a "Pull Request"?  
What is "Forking" a repo?
