### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101
#### meta
**Why do we separate HTML and CSS?**  <br/>
With a separate CSS file you can apply that style to multiple HTML pages so that they are using all of the same CSS. This comes in handy when you want to change something in CSS for multiple webpages.


#### HTML
**What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?**  <br/>
IDs can be used to identify specific elements in HTML. Classes are made in CSS and when applied to elements in HTML whatever you made in CSS will apply. Each element can only have one ID but you can put as many classes as you want in an element. 


**What are elements?**<br/>
elements make up the web page, tags mark the beginning and end of an element for example <body>  body is the element. 


**What are tags?** <br/>
tags help make up HTML, they surround elements and apply meaning to it. 


**What are attributes?** <br/>
attributes are additional information that go in between the tags of an element, these are in quotations and are often values.


**What are forms?**<br/>
Forms define a form that allows user inputted data to be sent somewhere.


**What is a div?** <br/>  
divs are used to add extra information to an existing chunk of information in HTML. A div can also be used to group existing sections of code together.


**What are selectors?** <br/> 
selectors are the names given to styles in internal and external style sheets. 

**What are properties?** <br/>  
Properties go inside the curly brackets of the selectors. These control specific things in the aesthetics of the web page.

**What are values?** <br/>  
values go after the properties in selectors. These control how much of the selector is happening and are followed by a semi-colon.

**How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?** <br/> 
Styles can be inherited from a parent element to a child element. So if you apply something to the unordered list, all of the list items will have it. 

**What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?** <br/>  
padding and margins 

**What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?**<br/>  
1. link the external styleet to your HTML
2. write CSS in your HTML as in on-page style defintions  
3. inline styles
