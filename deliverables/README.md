### Section 1: The Front End

What is the role of HTML in a web page?  
HTML provides the skeleton or structure upon which functional content within a web page will be built.  

What is the role of CSS in a web page?  
CSS provides the formatting and presentation of a web page that is separate from, but referenced to the HTML skeleton.  

What is the role of Javascript in a web page?  
The role of Javascript in a web page is multi-layered; for example: it allows for direct user interaction with the web page, it allows for one to build apps and games on a web page, it allows someone to access information on the internet.  These examples are introductory and are by no means exhaustive of the role Javascript has in a web page.

### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### Meta
Why do we separate HTML and CSS?  
We separate HTML and CSS for partly for conveneience and clarity, but mostly because they play different roles in designing a web page.  In addition to having slightly different syntaxes, HTML and CSS are designed to do different tasks; the HTML provides the skeleton of the web page, while the CSS provides the elements that make the base skeleton (i.e., HTML) more interesting, useful, and appealing.  Keeping them separate is both practical and asthetic.   

#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?  
Classes and IDs are markers used to identify certain elements within the HTML code and then referenced to in the CSS code to apply functional content and structural attributes to them.  Classes can be appllied to many elements within the HTML file whereas IDs can be applied to only a single element.  Within the CSS file, the class formatting is referenced with '.class' and the ID formatting is referenced with '#ID' (where the 'class' and 'ID' are the specific ones created in the HTML file.  

What are elements?  
HTML elements are entities that comprise different parts of a webpage, such as a title, headings, paragraphs, lists, and so on.  These HTML elements can be combined to construct useful and practical web pages.  

What are tags?  
HTML tags are markers that are used to construct the elements.  An HTML tag is typically comprised of an opening <-> and closing </-> where '-' is the type of element to be constructed; for example, 'p' for paragraph, 'ol' for ordered list, 'li' for a list element, and so on.  

What are attributes?  
Attributes are indicators used within tags to modify HTML elements.  They consist of a reference word, followed by an equals sign, and then a directive placed in quotation marks.  Attributes are placed after the initial opening tag bracket and tag type but before the initial closing bracket; it is possible to use several attributes within the same tag  

What are forms? 
HTML forms are elements designed to allow users to directly input information, select an option from a list, or designate certain values that apply to that user.  These HTML forms allow users to send information to a website's server directly to be processed.  

What is a div? 
An HTML div is an element that when used properly with opening and closing tags can be used to make different sections (or divisions) within a web page.  

#### CSS
What are selectors?  
What are properties?  
What are values?  
How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?  
What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?  

#### Android
Put your html code in the `android.html` file in this folder.
