### Section 2: HTML and CSS 101

#### meta
Why do we separate HTML and CSS?
You can do most CSS in the HTML (in line CSS), but it is easier to visualize and organize code if they are separated into "mark up" and "make up". Also by using a separate CSS file, you can have more complex and specifc instructions so there is less work. 



#### HTML
What are classes and IDs (and how are they different)?
Classes are groupings of content that you want the same CSS changes to be applied to. If you create (li class"fancy") this line along with all the other members of that class, will be treated the same. 
An ID applies to a single element that you want to be different from the of the same element. If you only wanted one line to have a partticular style, you can use the ID attribute. 
Classes and IDs give more specific instructions and functions compared to regular tags.

What are elements?  
Elements are the content of a particular tag. Ex. 'this is a paragraph', the text (this is a paragraph) is an element while the p are the tags. 

What are tags?  
Tags give specification to elements on where they will be in the code. Tags open with <> and close with </>. A tag of h3 blah blah h3 will be in a different place and have a different meaning than the same text with p tags. 

What are attributes?  Attributes are properties of code that assign a different meaning to a common tag. Ex. p id"serious". The ID makes the paragraph differnt than a normal paragraph.

What are forms? 
Forms are special elements called controls that are used to make things like check boxes, menus etc. 

What is a div?
Divs are containers that allow the code to be put into sections on the page. 

What are selectors? 
Selectors use attributes of an HTML element to select a specific element. Ex: # is a selector indicating ID in CSS.

What are properties?  
Once an attribute is assigned and the browser processes the code, a node will be created and these nodes have properties. Properties like align, alt, attributes etc. 

What are values?  
Values give a hexadecimal value to colors. Instead of red, there is #458393. It gives a value to colors. 

How do CSS styles for a particular element get inherited? ie. how does an element get its "default" styles?
The default styles are inherited, ie passed down to a younger generation, from the parent element to the child element. 

What are two CSS attributes you can change to push an element around on the page?  
You can use text-align or through commands like center me.

What are the three different ways to include CSS in your project or use CSS to style a particular element?  
You can use in line, external or embedded css.

### Section 3: Git and Github  
What is Git?
Git is a system that allows revision control for software development. 

What is SCM?  
Source code manager. Used to manage source code and track revisions in software.  

What is a VCS?  
Veritas Cluster Server provides cluster capabilities to systems running other applications. 

Why is Git useful for a developer?
Git stores and gives feedback to all of your code and allows you to maintain an organized workspace. 

Why is Git useful for a team of developers?  
Git allows a team to work together using all of the same files. Editing is done live so everyone can see the changes and add to them. 

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally? 
git init command creates a new project. 

How do you create it on Github?  
You can either use gits built in command line or a regular command line. 

How do you commit changes?  
You commit chanes at the bottom of the editing page. You can either commit to master or commit to other places. 

What is the difference between staging and committing changes?  
The staging is like a loading dock where you can chose what changes you want to commit. Commmitting is saying, I want these changes actually applied. 

What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?  
Commiting records changes to the local repo while pushing updates remote repositories. 

What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?  
git-status

What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  
git-log 

How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?  
Click on the number of commits button at the top of your profile in github. Ex. 34 commits. Click that and it will show you your history.

What is a "Merge"?  
A merge is when you join two or more development histories together. 

What is a "Pull Request"?  
Pull requests allow you to tell others about the changes you have pushed to a repo.

What is "Forking" a repo?  
A fork is a copy of a repo where you can make your own changes without affecting the original. 

What is "Cloning" a repo?  
Cloning is exactly copying one repo and being able to use it.
