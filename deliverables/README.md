They both indicate differt parts of your webpage that can be modified using CSS or Javascript. When one manipulates a class using CSS or Javascript they are modifying all the Ids within that class. When one edits a ID using CSS or Javascript they only manipulate one specific element of a webpage.

### Section 3: Git and Github  
What is Git?  
Git is a version Control system that helps keep track of changes in one's code.

What is SCM?  
SCM stands for "Supply Chain Management" which is the oversight of information, as they move in a process from supplier to developer and to userer.
What is a VCS? 
A version control system is a tool that a developer or group of developers use to keep track of changes with in a project.

Why is Git useful for a developer?  
Git allows a developer to track their changes in a program and experiment without messing up their working project.

Why is Git useful for a team of developers?  
Git allows a team of developers to track changes with in their document. It also useful if one wanted to have seperate team members modify certain features in an application. For example they can build seperate branches so they can experiment with the code without messing with the running product. 

How do you create a new Git repository for a project locally?  
"git init"

How do you create it on Github?  
Next to your username click the "+" icon and then click the "new repository" option.

How do you commit changes?  
"git commit"

What is the difference between staging and committing changes?  
Staging changes is a metaphorical loading dock where all your changes get shiped away by eventually commiting them. Where as commit records all changes to the repository. Thus staging gives you alot more flexibility to what you want to change specifically. 

What is the difference between committing your changes and pushing them to Github?  
Commiting your changes only saves them to your local repository where pushing them Github allows your team to expierment with your project

What is the command to check the status of your current repo in git?  
"git status"

What is the command to see the history of your previous commits (from the command line)?  What are a few interesting variations (sets of options)? 
"git log" Shows commit logs.
"git log -follow" Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file).
"git log -log-size" Include a line “log size <number>” in the output for each commit, where <number> is the length of that commit’s message in bytes. 

How can you look through your historical commits on the Github website?  
"http://github.com/<username>/<project>/commits/<branch>/"
<username> is the username of the person that owns the repo
<project> is the repo name
<branch> can be 'master' or any other branch

What is a "Merge"?  
Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.

What is a "Pull Request"?
These an area for discussion for when a developer makes a change on a repo and wants others to review it. 

What is "Forking" a repo? 
It's producing a personal copy of someone else’s project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. 

What is "Cloning" a repo?  
This will copy the entire history of that project so you have it locally and it will give you a working directory of the main branch of that project so you can look at the code or start editing it
