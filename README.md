# Ignition2015_reference

This repo is gonna be just a big list of commands we've learned.  Clone it to your own machine wherever you're working (your local computer, or Cloud9) and you can open it in your text editor to see the results.  Or just keep it open in your browser.  

This repo will grow over the course of Ignition.  If you are using a cloned copy, periodically do a `git pull` to get the latest content.
